## Project description

I wanted a tech-y way to display the days left until Christmas, so I decided to use an **M5Stack Atom Matrix** with its built-in 5*5 LED matrix to display the 25 days of December in the run-up to Christmas.

I used an ATOM Matrix from M5Stack, which is a small, cuboid development board for the ESP32 processor (specifically, a ESP32-PICO-D4), and it has an LED matrix built in. It has 25 LEDs, which is obviously perfect for an Advent counter!
